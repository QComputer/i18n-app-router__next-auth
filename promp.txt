I recently added coverImage and avatarImage optional String properties to Organization/Staff/ServiceCategory. First, check all relevant files in the codebase to identify existing property definitions, forms, and pages displaying these entities. Then implement image upload functionality using the existing image-upload.tsx component and lib/images/upload.ts utility, ensuring proper integration of coverImage and avatarImage fields into all applicable forms (including settings/profile-form.tsx if needed), and update all pages that now require displaying these new images. Verify the implementation works by running a build, then start the dev server to test end-to-end.
